# PathfinderVisualizer
C++ program that visualizes and compares BFS, DFS, A*, and Dijkstra pathfinding algorithms

To build and run the project
- Create a build folder and move to it
- Run cmake .. to create cmake files
- Run make to create executable main
- ./main to run the executable

When the program is running the user can draw walls and change the position of the starting and ending cells. The user must press the return key to start the pathfinding.

From top-left to bottom right: A*, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra
